First, though institutions were asked to retroactively code CDCP courses, it is likely that the most accurate course coding occurred in the 2006-2007 school year since this is when the state passed SB361 legislation. Thus, 2006-2007 represents the most precise representation of a cohort to date, and was also the first to experience partial effects of enhanced rate funding. We have confidence that this funding, combined with the excellence of our programs and support services, our college transition programs, and campaigns to increase the collection of students’ social security numbers, has led to an increase in the number of students transferring to credit colleges and the ability to track those transfers.",4,,

At SCE, students often take up to 2-3 years to complete a CDCP certificate; thus, it is reasonable that students would not have had enough time to achieve additional transfer outcomes beyond one credit course. Tracking the cohort for a longer time period may be more appropriate for studying noncredit students, who represent a diverse and often disadvantaged population that face barriers impeding a quick progression through the educational system.",3,,

The number of certificates awarded has grown every year at SCE, with the 2008-2009 school year boasting 471 certificate completions. Furthermore, excluding students from the cohort that were not first-time students or that initially were enrolled in credit courses discounts the positive outcomes achieved by the sizable population that start in credit and subsequently enroll in noncredit for basic skills development or career preparation. Finally, an important goal of CDCP courses is to prepare students for employment, and many students will choose to enter the workforce rather than transfer.

For example, the student progress and achievement rate declined from 2007/08 to 2008/09 following an upward trend in previous years. This is interesting in light of the increase in the percent of students earning 30+ units, and may be related to the difficulties of transferring in the current economic situation in California. Trends in course completion rates in vocational and basic skills courses appear to be areas of concern, however the decreases in these metrics are primarily explained by a change in the methodology by which they are calculated that occurred beginning 2007/08.

Annual course completion rates in basic skills courses have improved over the prior year (63.5% compared to 65.4%). Student progress and achievement rates have increased almost one percentage point over the prior year. Despite these gains the college is below peer group averages in some of these benchmarks such as persistence and credit basic skills and ESL courses rates.

Solano completed two semiannual, formal reports and underwent concomitant site visits. These accreditation activities demanded additional focus and change for its faculty, staff, and management team. Concurrently, the State moved deeper into financial crisis and projected severe cuts in funding for community colleges. Mid-year budget cuts included a reduction in the number of course sections offered, a hiring freeze on staff, and cutbacks in supplies and equipment purchases. Finally, the College re-implemented major portions of its integrated database system, with all the attendant extra work and glitches involved. Although these unusual factors all impacted on the stress and work levels of everyone at the institution, the relatively steady state of most college-level indicators demonstrate that, through the dedication and hard work of faculty and staff, students were shielded from negative impacts.",7,,

Annually, between 70-80% of Solano’s new students enter with reading, writing, and math skills below college level. The basic skills needs of our students are very great. The remodel of the Reading/Writing labs has improved the learning environment and, modestly, increased the number of developmental English students we serve. “Focused Inquiry Groups (FIGs) have led participating faculty members to experiments with a new Basic Skills Composition course (ENGL 348E) that, if successful, is designed to permit SCC to serve more students. Ongoing developments in the basic skills Composition Course (ENGL 350/355), which is two levels below College Composition, builds stronger links between the co-requisite reading and writing lab exercises. The College has also conducted experiments in a “first-year experience” model with an English course and a Counseling course joined as a learning community. All these endeavors have laid the foundations for the creation of a Center for Academic Success that will offer SCC students workshops on all variety of topics related to successful learning outcomes in college classes across the curriculum. The steady (3%) increase in the annual successful course completion rate for basic skills courses demonstrates the initial success of the BSI program.

While the recent cuts have been particularly steep, they are part of a long-term trend that has seen the state’s annual appropriation to the University decline in inflation-adjusted dollars by 54 percent from 1990-91 to 2009-10. Funding for educational facilities also is in short supply.

These are shown for the first time in this year’s report and will be tracked annually hereafter.

In the trend data in particular there is evidence that the quality of a UC education is threatened, as are the University’s accessibility to all of California’s eligible students, its affordability and its diversity. Because most indicators of the University’s health lag budget actions by at least a year, it is too soon to know the full impact on the University of the most recent and severe financial downturn. Eight trends in particular are called out here for continued careful attention:",4,,
951-05-10-34,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"1. Enrollment. The total number of new students declined in 2009, reflecting a policy decision taken in 2008-09 to begin reducing the number of undergraduate students for whom no state funds were being made available (estimated in 2008-09 at close to 15,000 undergraduates). Freshman enrollments were curtailed by 2,300 for fall 2009 and 1,500 for fall 2010, more than offsetting the planned growth of 500 additional community college transfers in each of those years. This net reduction in total new enrollments occurred at a time when the number of eligible California high school graduates reached record highs.",3,,
951-05-10-35,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"2. Affordability. The total cost of an undergraduate education in 2008-09 did not increase for independent students and for students from families earning less than $60,000 per year. This testifies to the strength of the University’s financial aid program. The proportion of undergraduates who graduated with student loan debt also remained relatively stable at around 52 percent, as did the level of inflation-adjusted cumulative average debt that students incurred. In the next few years, the data on undergraduates may begin to reveal the impact of the steep fee increases that totaled 32 percent for 2009-10 and 2010-11 combined. If they do, they may resemble some professional degree programs where steep fee increases over the past decade very evidently have impacted the affordability of these programs.",5,,

Professional degree fees have risen dramatically in recent years, especially for medicine, law and business. And they have been extended to other programs such as public health, public policy and social welfare. Average indebtedness has grown among professional degree students in response, by as much as 10 percent per year among students studying for law, medicine, education and health degrees other than medicine. Additionally, the number of professional degree students graduating with debt has grown.",5,,
951-05-10-37,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"3. Teaching and learning. A new section on teaching and learning presents survey data gathered every two years that demonstrates that undergraduates have a high degree of satisfaction with their UC experience. The student-faculty ratio (a proxy for either a university’s investment in instruction or a measure of the average availability of faculty members for a student) has been relatively stable at UC since 1994. This stability, however, obscures underlying changes in the overall composition of the faculty, including a reduction in the proportion of ladder-rank faculty.",3,,
951-05-10-38,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"Also of concern are data revealed by two indicators that are new to this year’s report: one showing just how much credit toward an undergraduate degree is earned in large classes and another showing growth in the proportion of instruction that is taken on by faculty who are not on permanent appointments and, as such, not as engaged in research. Contact with research and the people who conduct it is a hallmark of a UC education. It is too soon to know what impact budget cuts will have on the composition of UC faculty; however, the University anticipates that class sizes are likely to increase.",2,,
951-05-10-39,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"4. Student success. Four-year completion rates continue to improve for undergraduates who enter the University as freshmen. The proportion graduating in four years has increased from 42 percent for freshmen entering in 1996 to 60 percent for freshmen entering in 2005. But the data are not yet available for students affected by the recent severe budget cuts. These cuts produce countervailing pressures. Steep fee increases can provide incentive to students to finish their undergraduate degrees as quickly as possible. However, as fewer classes are made available, progress toward degree completion could be slowed.",5,,
951-05-10-40,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"5. Research. The University’s research enterprise continues robustly. It persists at the top end of indices that rank universities worldwide and that adopt methodologies emphasizing research outputs. UC also routinely accounts for 9 percent of the research expenditures made by all U.S. universities. When 2009-10 data on research expenditures become available, it is likely to reveal continued, even expanded, growth due in large part to the University’s success in attracting more than $800 million of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding that was devoted to research and flowed to universities through federal and other funding agencies awarding multi-year grants in 2009-10.",3,,
951-05-10-41,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"In addition, the University produces a large number of the nation’s most eminent scholars. In 2009 and 2010, the prestigious National Academy of Sciences admitted 144 new members, 66 of them from public universities. More than half of those admitted from public universities (39) were from the University of California.",3,,
951-05-10-42,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"6. Recruitment and retention of faculty and staff. The University remains concerned about its ability to recruit and retain its world-class faculty and the staff who support them in instruction, research, patient health care, student services and the many other enterprises in which they and the University are involved. Data from the 2009 total remuneration study (a survey that took into account all forms of compensation including salaries and benefits) demonstrate that with the exception of service workers, UC’s total compensation is below market (4 to 7 percent below market for its faculty and up to 14 percent for some of its staff). At the same time, its work force is aging: 54 percent of its faculty and 35 percent of its staff are over the age of 50. Accordingly, UC will need to emphasize faculty and staff renewal at a time when it is at a considerable competitive disadvantage in the marketplace with regard to the salaries it offers.",4,,
951-05-10-43,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"7. Financial responses. The report demonstrates how the University has steadily expanded its reliance on non-state funding. Student fee increases and the University’s successes in attracting research grant funding are two examples. The report also documents that the amount of funds generated by auxiliary services and endowment funding has grown. But the report is careful to manage expectations about how far reliance on non-state funding can stretch. While the University’s revenues are large—more than $20 billion in 2009—the majority are generated by research grants and contracts and auxiliary services (a category that includes hospitals and medical centers as well as parking garages and student housing and dining services). Student fees and state funding are largely responsible for covering core academic costs, which include faculty salaries, libraries, instructional technologies, student services and other academic support services. And while state and fee funds may be supplemented from other sources, non-state and non-fee funds are typically restricted to specific purposes for which they are designated and would need in any event to grow in an unprecedented fashion before noticeably making up for the diminution in state funds. Endowment funds, for example, would need to grow by more than 250 percent in order for the interest paid upon them to make up for the cuts meted out by the state in 2008-09 alone.",8,,
951-05-10-44,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"The University also continues its multi-year quest to achieve cost efficiencies in virtually all of its operations. In future years, we hope to include a methodologically sound way to present its progress.",2,,
951-05-10-45,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"8. Diversity. The University is especially challenged here. African Americans, American Indians and Chicano/Latinos are less well represented among the University’s students, faculty and staff than they are in the state as a whole, and women are less well represented than men in faculty and senior management positions. As the September 2009 Accountability SubReport on Diversity demonstrated, degree completion rates are lower for students from particular populations (African-American and Chicano/Latino males, for example) than for white or Asian students, and the University needs to pay more attention to this area (www.universityofcalifornia.edu/accountability).",3,,
951-05-10-46,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"While there is considerable variation across campuses and across disciplines and evidence of real progress in selected areas, a great deal more remains to be done in order to realize the commitment renewed by the Board of Regents in 2007 to support diversity and equal opportunity and to promote a culture of tolerance, inclusiveness and respect on each campus. Progress needs to be made within the legal limitations of Proposition 209, which eliminated considerations of race, ethnicity and gender in admissions and hiring, and in the context of severe budget cuts that have required the University to curtail enrollments, reduce the number of new faculty hires, eliminate staff positions and increase student fees.",2,,

951-05-10-50,951,University of California: Annual Accountability Report,2010,California,189,9,0,"GOALS AND CHALLENGES: In 1960, California’s Master Plan for Higher Education transformed a collection of uncoordinated and competing colleges and universities into a coherent system and unique model of higher education. It did this by assigning each public segment—the University of California (UC), the California State University system (CSU) and the California Community Colleges (CCC)—its own distinctive mission and pool of students, while maintaining the principle of low-cost public higher education and universal access and choice. The University of California became the state’s public research university, with responsibility to admit the top 12.5 percent of students from the graduating high school class, to conduct research and to award doctoral and professional degrees.",3,,

The University’s share of the state’s general fund has dropped from 8.1 percent in 1966-67 to 3.1 percent in 2009-10. California itself has changed dramatically over the past 40 years. It has grown greatly in size and diversity and its public K-12 education system, once a leader nationally, is ranked 43rd by the National Education Association (NEA) among all states in 2008-09 with regard to current expenditures per student. California also ranks 46th in eighth-grade math achievement and 47th in eighth-grade reading achievement, according to the most recent assessments by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).",4,,

That at least has been the claim of its proponents through successive generations since the public education movement began in the United States.

In three sections, it evaluates the extent to which UC undergraduates are drawn from disadvantaged backgrounds and the extent to which they succeed during and after their university careers. The essay also discusses how some of the fiscal challenges currently facing the University, such as proposed reductions in student financial aid at both the federal and state level, could significantly reduce the University’s ability to admit and graduate large numbers of disadvantaged students. Disadvantaged students are defined as those from low-income families, those whose parents have not earned a college degree, and those who come from underrepresented minorities (URMs). These are the students who historically, and today as well, have had less access to higher education and less likelihood of graduating from college once admitted.",5,,

Eligibility for a Pell grant has changed over the years; in 2010–11 students were eligible for a Pell if their family income was less than about $50,000. In fall 2010, almost 40 percent, or 70,000, of all UC undergraduates were Pell recipients, the largest percentage in the University’s history.",2,,

Overall, 31 percent of undergraduates at UC received a Pell grant in 2008–09 compared to 17 percent at the non-UC AAU publics and 13 percent at the AAU privates (Indicator 3.5). The proportion of Pell recipients at individual UC campuses ranged from 25 percent (at Irvine and Santa Barbara) to 42 percent (at Merced and Riverside). But percentages alone do not tell the whole story; to do that, one must also look at the number of students involved. In 2009–10, for example, four UC campuses — Los Angeles, Davis, San Diego and Berkeley — each enrolled more Pell grant recipients than the entire Ivy League combined.

950-05-11-42,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"UC’s exceptional success at enrolling low-income students is due, in part, to a combination of two strong need-based aid programs: the University’s own institutional aid program and the state’s Cal Grant program. UC’s need-based grant program is funded, in part, by returning a share of new fee revenue back to financial aid in the form of UC grants. More than 50,000 UC students also currently receive a Cal Grant, which typically covers recipients’ systemwide tuition and fees, including tuition and fee increases. Indeed, the existence of this generous state-funded program enables the University to provide grants and scholarships to other students who may not be eligible for a Cal Grant. While students at other institutions often benefit from either a strong institutional aid program or a strong state aid program, UC students benefit from both.",5,,

In 2009–10, for example, UC students received more than $1.5 billion in financial aid: this included $443 million in UC grants; $425 million in Cal Grants funded through the state; and $286 million in federal Pell grants. More than 90 percent of these awards were made to undergraduates, both low- and middle-income students, with financial need. As a consequence, the net cost of attending the University has actually declined for low-income students in inflation-adjusted dollars since 2004–05 (Indicator 3.2).",4,,

So it is no surprise that reliable, simple and predictable financial aid is important, especially for low-income students who may come from families that believe that a college education, especially at an elite university, is simply beyond their financial reach.",2,,

First-generation status matters: having parents with college degrees can provide students with the role models, family expectations, life experiences and financial resources that ease a student’s transition from high school to college and that contribute to their success. Indeed, many studies have shown that first-generation students are less likely to enroll in college and, once enrolled, less likely to graduate compared to students who have a parent with a college degree.",3,,

Like low-income students, the proportion of first-generation students is also larger at UC than at any of its comparison institutions. In 2007–08, 42 percent of undergraduate students at UC were first generation compared to 34 percent at a set of very selective public research universities and 24 percent at very selective private research universities (Indicator 2.5).

Enrollment of URM students, especially at public institutions like UC that primarily admit in-state students, is shaped to some extent by state demographic profiles. The largest growing minority population in the country, Hispanics, is heavily concentrated in sunbelt states, such as California, Texas, Arizona and Florida. However, among AAU publics, Berkeley and UCLA rank medium (in the 15–20 percent range) in terms of the proportion of underrepresented minority students; public flagship universities in Arizona, Florida and Texas, all of which also have substantial Hispanic populations, enroll more than 20 percent underrepresented minority students.",4,,

However, the proportion of underrepresented minority students is lower at UC than at some of its peer institutions in part because proportionately fewer URM students are academically well prepared for college (and hence do not meet UC’s admissions criteria), and in part because of legal restrictions. Beginning with the entering class of 1998, Proposition 209 prohibited the University from considering race and ethnicity in admissions. In addition, highly talented students from underrepresented minorities are highly sought after by elite private universities that do not face the same legal restrictions on affirmative action that UC does and can offer very generous financial aid packages. Despite these challenges, the proportion of UC’s enrolled freshmen who come from underrepresented minorities has increased steadily from the low point in 1998. A new freshman admissions policy, effective fall 2012, is designed to broaden the pool of students whose applications will receive a comprehensive review and to possibly increase the number of underrepresented students admitted to UC.",6,,

State funding for instruction at UC has declined 50 percent per student since 1990 (Indicator 1.5). Student tuition and fees have been increased in response, but have only partially compensated for the loss of state dollars. Despite substantial reductions in state support, the University has maintained, and in many cases extended, access to disadvantaged low-income, first-generation and underrepresented minority students. Certainly, the increased availability of financial aid dollars explains some of this trend, as does UC’s commitment to opening up doors of opportunity to all students. Middle-income students, however, are less likely to qualify for need-based grant programs that have offset some or all of recent cost increases for low-income students. Indeed, the share of students from middle-income families has declined slightly (Indicator 3.5). Although more analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this decline, it may be that UC is less attractive to middle-income students than it has been in the past. To address this, the University is considering ways to improve both its message about financial aid for middleincome students and the amount of aid available to those students.",9,,

Educationally, completing a baccalaureate degree provides recognition that a student has achieved mastery over a specific subject matter and acquired a basic set of social and cognitive skills, such as the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and work collaboratively with others — all skills that are needed in an increasingly global economy. Psychologically, college graduation symbolizes a student’s ability to begin a program and see it through to the end, and in this sense is a measure of persistence. Economically, students who complete a baccalaureate degree have higher annual salaries and greater lifetime earnings than those who do not. According to a 2010 report from the College Board, the median earnings of a bachelor’s recipient working full-time year-round were $55,700 in 2008 — or $22,000 more than the median earnings of a high school graduate — and the unemployment rate of high school graduates in 2009 was 2.6 times higher than that for college graduates.",5,,

There are similar gaps in the educational attainment of students by family income, parental education, race/ethnicity, and gender at UC as well. However, the overall graduation rates are higher, and the gaps in graduation rates between more advantaged and less advantaged students, are not as great at UC as they are at peer universities, indicating that a higher proportion of disadvantaged low-income, first-generation and URM students graduate fromUC than from peer institutions.

Graduation rates are correlated with academic preparation — the higher students’ academic preparation levels (based on high school GPAs and SAT/ACT scores), the more likely they are to graduate, and to graduate more quickly, in four years rather than six. Family income is also correlated with academic preparation, and low-income students tend to be less well prepared academically than higher-income students. When UC students are divided into thirds based on their levels of academic preparation, for example, disproportionately more low-income students (47 percent) fall into the bottom third, and disproportionately fewer (20 percent) fall into the top third in terms of academic preparation.

Certainly, there are differences among students and across campuses — average SAT critical reading and math scores in 2008 across the UC campuses, for example, ranged from 1042 at Merced to 1319 at Berkeley — nonetheless, UC still admits, and enrolls, a more academically homogenous and higher-performing group of students than most of its AAU public peers.",5,,

Despite these differences, what’s most remarkable is how similar these two vastly different groups of students look after college graduation — a similarity that speaks to the ability of a UC education not only to erase some of the most obvious social class differences that characterized its entering students, but also to promote the social and economic mobility of its least-advantaged students. Unfortunately we do not have access to comparable data to assess the extent to which UC graduates are similar to, or different from, those of peer institutions in this regard.",3,,
950-05-11-88,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"DISCUSSION: Study after study has shown that college graduates earn significantly more than high school graduates, both on an annual basis and cumulatively over their lifetimes. There are exceptions to this generalization, but more important, there are significant differences in earnings potential of college graduates across college majors. A May 2011 report, What’s it Worth: The Economic Value of College Majors, from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, used Census Bureau data from more than 3 million bachelor’s degree holders in the United States to explore the median salaries and career paths of college graduates over the past 40 years. Some of the results were to be expected. Science, engineering and business majors tended to be better off financially than liberal arts and humanities majors. In addition, the study found that women and underrepresented minority students tended to cluster in low-paying fields that had few opportunities for advancement, such as education and social work; some undergraduate majors also essentially required a graduate degree to secure a good job. This is not altogether surprising, at least for students from underrepresented minorities who are also first-generation college goers. Historically, social mobility has been a multi-generational phenomenon, and some low-paid professional careers, such as teaching, have served as important stepping-stones for the first upwardly mobile generation.",8,,
950-05-11-89,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Although data from UC’s Undergraduate Alumni Survey are not detailed enough to allow us to explore how students from different racial/ethnic, class and educational backgrounds allocated themselves across different majors and what impact this had on their earnings, they do show some difference in income distribution among graduates from lower and higher socio-economic backgrounds.",1,,
950-05-11-90,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Additionally, there are wide disparities by race/ethnicity in terms of how students distribute themselves into both UC’s undergraduate and graduate and professional degree programs. African American and Chicano/Latino students, for example, are less likely to enter some of the higherpaying graduate and professional degree majors such as business, engineering and the physical and life sciences and more likely to be found in education, which is one of the lower-paying professions. Medicine is a major exception: in 2008, almost 20 percent of UC’s first-year medical students were under-represented students compared to a national average of 14.5 percent (Indicator 8.7). How the differential allocation of students by race/ethnicity, class and firstgeneration status into both undergraduate and graduate majors affects their future earnings, and their socio-economic mobility in general, is a question for further analysis.",4,,
950-05-11-91,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"The data are clearer about how UC’s selectivity and the relatively rich availability of student financial aid support the success of students from lowincome families and underrepresented minorities. UC selects its freshman admits from the top eighth of all California high school graduates and admits qualified community college transfer students. It also defines the curricular pathways students must follow to achieve an offer of admission. In this regard, UC defines its pipeline more rigorously than its peer public institutions; this in turn helps contribute to the relative success of UC’s graduates compared to its public peers, at least as measured by their time to degree.",4,,
950-05-11-92,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Sustained commitments to student financial aid at the state, federal and institutional levels have also been essential to maintaining access for, and supporting the success of, low- and middle-income students, especially as costs to attend the University have increased in recent years. Pell grants represented $286 million (or about 20 percent) of the grants and scholarships available to UC undergraduates in 2009-10. A range of proposals to scale back the federal Pell grant program to varying degrees could put at risk financial support to low-income students.",3,,
950-05-11-93,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"At the state level, the Cal Grant program contributed $425 million (or another 30 percent) of all grants and scholarships available to UC undergraduates in 2009-10. That program too is at risk owing to the state’s continuing structural financial challenges. Should either of these programs be scaled back significantly we would likely see higher levels of student debt, more hours of student work, or a reduction in the number of highly talented but financially needy students aspiring to attend UC. If this were to happen, UC’s ability to promote the social mobility of large numbers of disadvantaged students — and their ability to rise above the cumulative weight of race, class and social disadvantages — could be severely compromised.",4,,
950-05-11-94,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Increasing access and graduation rates for low-income, first-generation and underrepresented students is a societal issue; no single institution can do it alone. But to the extent that UC is able to continue to open its doors to underprivileged students in California and foster their success, it helps promote social and economic equality. And to the extent that the disadvantaged students it admits graduate in significant numbers and go on to achieve occupational and professional success, it demonstrates to the state of California, and to the people of California, what can be accomplished by a very high quality public research university. To succeed in that mission, the University needs continuing high levels of support both for its very successful student financial aid programs, and for its academic programs in general. Academic preparation of students from underrepresented and low-income families is also vital since UC’s effectiveness as an engine for social mobility can only really be felt by students who are admitted to, attend and graduate from the university.",5,,

950-05-11-173,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,Goals: UC seeks to ensure that financial considerations are not an obstacle to eligible students who seek to complete a University degree. Its student financial aid program is designed with this goal in view.,2,,
950-05-11-174,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Narrative: UC closely monitors the impact of its pricing decisions and its financial aid program with a variety of affordability indicators. For example, it routinely assesses the cost of attending UC for families at different income levels. It also monitors the enrollment of low- and middle-income students, how much students need to work during a term and how much money they borrow to pay for their education.",3,,
950-05-11-175,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"The indicators in this section show that the University remains accessible to students from all income groups, despite the increases in student tuition and fees that are forced on the University by the withdrawal of state funding. Despite continuing upward pressure on student tuition and fees, the proportion of lower-income students enrolled in UC grew in 2010. Due to the availability of student financial aid programs, the inflation-adjusted net cost paid by low-income students for their University education has declined since 2004–05. ",3,,
950-05-11-176,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Meanwhile, the inflation-adjusted net cost for lower middle-income students has been flat during the last five years, but the cost for upper-middle income and wealthier students has risen substantially. The balance of students from low-, middle-, and high-income families has changed during the past decade, with the largest decline in the proportion of upper-middle-income students. This chapter offers some explanations.",3,,
950-05-11-177,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Looking forward: UC’s commitment to affordability is especially important at a time when the University is forced by the withdrawal of state support to raise student tuition and fees. Evidence of that commitment is the University’s Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, which ensures that needy students with household incomes below a threshold level receive gift aid to cover their tuition and fees. For 2011–12, the threshold was raised to $80,000; the threshold was set at $70,000 in 2010–11 and $60,000 in 2009–10. Additionally, in 2011–12, UC will provide a grant to fully cover the cost of the 8 percent 2011–12 tuition increase for students with need from families earning incomes up to $120,000. The University also has started raising donations for Project You Can, a fundraising initiative that aims to raise $1 billion in private support during the next four years for student aid. ",5,,

950-05-11-258,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"Narrative: The main themes identified in this chapter are somewhat different for graduate academic and professional degree students. For graduate academics they revolve around two factors: the size of the graduate academic student body and the availability of financial aid to support them. During the last 50 years, undergraduate enrollment growth far outpaced that for graduates, as the University accommodated California’s burgeoning number of high school graduates. As a result, the proportion of graduate students at UC has decreased from about 30 percent of all enrollment in the mid-1960s to 22 percent in fall 2010. Offering financial support necessary to recruit the best students continues to be a challenge for UC’s graduate academic programs. Given the vital role that graduate academic students play in contributing to the quality and effectiveness of UC’s research and teaching enterprises, the trends documented here demonstrate that the University’s research enterprise continues robustly at the present time.",6,,
950-05-11-259,950,University of California Annual Accountability Report,2011,California,197,9,0,"For professional schools and their students, the story is told against the same backdrop of declining state support. Historically, UC’s professional schools offered a top-quality education at a reasonable price. In 1994, in response to state budget cuts, the University implemented professional degree supplemental tuition charges to build the resources necessary for professional schools to recruit and retain excellent faculty, provide an outstanding curriculum and attract high-caliber students. These charges are levied in addition to the mandatory tuition set by the Board of Regents and required from all students. Since 1994, the number of professional schools that charge supplemental tuition has increased steadily, as has the level of tuition. One result is that debt levels have increased for those graduating with a UC professional degree. Additionally, as is evident in Chapter 8 (Diversity), accessibility is becoming an issue. In 2011–12, 49 professional schools will charge supplemental tuition ranging from $4,002 to $35,148 over and above the mandatory rate that applies to all students.",8,,

Measures of research quality and impact are notoriously difficult to generate, and there is little agreement on their validity or use. Accordingly, after a brief introduction to the composition of the University’s research workforce, this chapter focuses on measures of research quantity, including research expenditures and journal publication. Focusing on research finances demonstrates the increasing importance of research at UC, whose growth has outpaced all other categories of University expenditures and which now represents about one quarter of the annual budget. However, these fiscal and personnel measures do not present a comprehensive account of UC’s diverse research programs.

They include the opening of the new Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis, the creation of new programs in medical education that focus specifically on the needs of medically underserved communities at each UC medical school, and ongoing efforts to establish a new medical school focusing on the needs of California’s Inland Empire at UC Riverside. Development of the California Telemedicine Network, a statewide initiative led by UC, with funding from the state’s Proposition 1D, will provide needed infrastructure to expand access to specialty services through telemedicine. Similarly, the new UC Center for Health Quality and Innovation, launched by UC Health in 2010, is expected to promote and advance innovations in clinical care that will improve patient outcomes and quality of care with the UC system and beyond.

The areas of focus are employee relations, labor relations, compensation and benefits. The University is striving to construct programs that provide value and engage its employees. In the systemwide staff engagement survey, offering competitive compensation was highlighted. Recognizing that quality personnel are essential for maintaining excellence, one of the University’s foremost concerns has been to achieve market-competitive total compensation for its employees. The goal of offering competitive compensation was adopted by the Regents in 2005 as part of a ten-year plan to bring compensation and benefits to market levels.

These challenges are likely to increase, particularly as the economy recovers and as other educational institutions, as well as nonhigher education employers, are in a position to recruit away UC’s top performers. The staff turnover rate (which, at 8.9 percent in 2011-12, was near its lowest level in a decade) is also expected to increase as the economic recession ends and employment opportunities in California improve.

This goal is articulated in California’s Master Plan for Higher Education, which calls for UC to admit all eligible freshmen and transfers with freshman eligibility defined to capture the top 12.5 percent of California public high school graduates. It also calls for UC to admit all qualified transfer students from California Community Colleges (CCCs).",3,,

Campus admission decisions are based on a comprehensive review of qualifications and establish the incoming California resident class size based on state funding. Increased state support allowed the University to enroll over 7,000 additional California residents (freshmen and transfers) in fall 2016 compared to fall 2015 — the biggest increase since World War II.",3,,
944-05-17-88,944,Annual Accountability Report,2017,California,227,9,0,"The University received $20 million in one-time funding in the 2016–17 state budget to support the admission, enrollment and success of underrepresented minority and low-income students, particularly those from high schools with a high concentration of students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or eligible for free or reduced- price meals. These funds supported campus programs serving an estimated 29,000 students from such high schools already enrolled at UC, as well as expanded outreach to potential future students.",2,,
944-05-17-89,944,Annual Accountability Report,2017,California,227,9,0,UC’s goal is to enroll entering cohorts that are close to a 2:1 ratio of freshman to transfer students.

UC continues to reach its Master Plan goals by guaranteeing admission to applicants from California who are either in the top nine percent of high school graduates statewide or the top nine percent of graduates from their own high school.

UC has moved closer to that ratio, from 2.32:1 in 2012–13 to 2.27:1 in 2015–16 (universitywide). The universitywide ratio (excluding Merced) is estimated to rise slightly from 2.16 to 2.20 for 2016-17.

Of the first 12 cohorts, 98 percent earned undergraduate degrees and 70 percent are either currently enrolled in graduate school or have already earned graduate degrees. Moreover, twelve UC LEADS alumni are now serving as tenure-track faculty, including four within the UC system.",6,,

UC’s overall excellence rests on the strength and scope of its graduate programs. Unlike undergraduate enrollment planning, which is based on California’s Master Plan, graduate enrollment planning is based on factors including the assessment of state and national needs, faculty expertise, program quality (which includes international competitiveness) and available financial support. Over the last 50 years, as the University accomodated California’s burgeoning number of high school graduates, undergraduate enrollment growth has far outpaced graduate enrollment growth. As a result, the proportion of graduate students to undergraduates on the general campuses has decreased from about 30 percent in the 1960s to less than 20 percent today. Given the critical contributions of graduate students to the University’s teaching and research mission and their role as innovation drivers, this change is notable and it places UC well below its peer institutions.",6,,

Prior to 2010–11, state funding was the largest single source of support for the education function of the University. Over the past ten years, state educational appropriations have fallen nearly $1 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars despite UC’s enrollment growth. State educational appropriations constituted only 10 percent of UC’s revenues in 2015–16 compared to 23 percent in 2001–02 (excluding DOE laboratories).",4,,
944-05-17-987,944,Annual Accountability Report,2017,California,227,9,0,"To offset declines in state funding, the University has sought to increase revenues from other sources, such as student tuition and fees, indirect cost recovery and private giving. The University also has moved to reduce operating costs and identify new sources of revenues. Chapter 13 identifies some of these cost savings. Even under optimistic assumptions, however, efficiency improvements and alternative revenue generation can meet only a portion of the projected needs.",4,,
944-05-17-988,944,Annual Accountability Report,2017,California,227,9,0,"What this means for students and families: Although the inflation-adjusted cost of educating a student at UC has dropped by 22 percent since 1990, the state’s share of this cost has fallen even more steeply, so students and their families now bear a larger share. Increases in student fees have not made up for the reductions in state support, thus total per-student expenditures have fallen.",2,,

Historically, certain revenues were collected centrally and redistributed. Following consultation with campus leadership, nearly all campus-generated funds — tuition and fees, research indirect cost recovery, and patent and investment income — are retained by or returned to the source campus. The University has established a broad-based assessment on campus funds to support the Office of the President and systemwide initiatives. These changes — referred to as the Funding Streams Initiative — have simplified planning, improved transparency and motivated campuses to maximize revenue.",5,,

The rate examined colleges that took students from the bottom 40 percent to the top 40 percent of the economic spectrum. In combination with the “success rate,” which measured the percent of lower-income students who ended up in the top 40 percent, the table shows UC’s continuing strength as an “upward-mobility machine.” UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UCLA were especially effective in moving students from a lower-income family to a higher- income family.",4,,
